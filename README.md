*DESCRIPTION*  :   
This project is a Smart Text Summarizer developed in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface and Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques for the core summarization logic. The tool allows users to input any length of text, process it intelligently, and receive a concise, meaningful summary based on the most relevant content. It uses NLTK for sentence tokenization and stopword removal, and scikit-learnâ€™s TF-IDF Vectorizer and Cosine Similarity methods to identify the most important sentences in the input. The summarizer applies extractive summarization, meaning it selects and presents actual sentences from the original input rather than generating new ones. The GUI is clean, responsive, and user-friendly, making it easy for non-technical users to summarize text with a single click. This tool can be especially useful for students, researchers, journalists, or anyone who regularly works with large amounts of textual information and needs to quickly distill key points. It works entirely offline and does not require any external APIs.
